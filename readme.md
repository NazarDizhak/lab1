Variant: <mark>none</mark>
## Prerequisites

<mark>g++, cmake, python3. list of required libraries for python in requirements.txt</mark>

### Compilation

<mark>run ./compile.sh in root folder</mark>

### Installation

<mark>just clone the repository</mark>

### Usage

<mark>In /scripts run the program1_runner or program2_runner. You will get statistics of each method (min time, mean time, deviation) into  your terminal, separated with a "\n" inbetween.</mark> <br>
<mark> Here is how to these programs: </mark> <br>
For program1 - "python3 program1_runner.py <datafile> <runs> <clear_cache> <output_csv>"


For program2 - "python3 program2_runner.py <datafile> <runs> <output_csv>"

<mark>Also, running these programs will result in creating the statistics of these runs in the data folder. It can be further used by compute_graph.py to create a graph that would be saved in the same folder for later use of your choice</mark>


### Important!

<mark>compute_graph.py is very prinitive, so any path and name changes of the output have to be changed manually inside the code itself</mark>
